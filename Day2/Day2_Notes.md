# 📘 Day 2 – From Mask Detection to Python: AI Gets Real!

---

## 🎯 Today’s Mission

- Train a basic **AI classification model** (Mask Detection)
- Understand key ML terms like **features, labels, datasets**
- Explore **real tools** like Teachable Machine & AI for Oceans
- Get introduced to **Machine Learning** and its types

## 🩺 1. Mask Detection – A Real AI Classification Task

> Objective: Train a model to classify people as **"Wearing a Mask"** 😷 or **"Not Wearing a Mask"** 🙅

### 🔧 How it works:
- You train the model with **labeled images**
- It identifies **patterns (features)** like nose or mouth visibility
- It **learns rules** and gets better through feedback

## 📌 2. Key Terminologies in Machine Learning

| Term           | What It Means |
|----------------|---------------|
| 🧠 **Model** | AI system trained to make predictions |
| 🔢 **Features** | Data properties (e.g., visible nose) |
| 🏷️ **Labels** | Class names like “Mask” or “No Mask” |
| 📦 **Dataset** | Group of data used to train/test AI |
| 🎯 **Accuracy** | % of correct predictions made by the model |
| 🔧 **Hyperparameters** | Settings like learning rate or training cycles |

🧪 Dataset Types:
- **Training Set** – Teaches the model
- **Validation Set** – Tunes the model
- **Test Set** – Evaluates final model performance

## 🤖 3. Teachable Machine (by Google)

- **Link:** [https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- Upload or record data ➡️ train a model ➡️ get instant feedback
- You used it to **detect mask-wearing in real-time!**

---

## 🖍️ 4. Annotation – Teaching the Machine

- **Definition:** Adding **labels** to raw data (images, audio, etc.)
- **Why it matters:** Machines can’t "understand" data unless we **explain it with labels**

## 🌊 5. AI for Oceans – Learn Through Play

- **Link:** [AI for Oceans – Code.org](https://studio.code.org/s/oceans/lessons/1/levels/2)
- You trained AI to detect **fish vs. trash**
- Helped you understand **bias, labeling, and feedback loops**
